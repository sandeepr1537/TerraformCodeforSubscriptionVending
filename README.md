# TerraformCodeforSubscriptionVending

Subscription vending in Azure refers to the automated provisioning and management of Azure subscriptions, often as part of a larger enterprise governance framework. This process allows organizations to quickly and consistently create new Azure subscriptions for different teams, projects, or workloads, ensuring they adhere to predefined policies, configurations, and standards.

Key Components of Subscription Vending
1. Automated Subscription Creation:
Automating the creation of new Azure subscriptions using tools like Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
This ensures consistency and adherence to organizational policies from the moment a new subscription is created.

2. Policy Enforcement:
Applying Azure Policy to enforce compliance with organizational standards.
Policies can include restrictions on resource types, location constraints, tagging requirements, and security configurations.
Resource Group Provisioning:

3. Automatically creating necessary resource groups within the new subscription.
Pre-configuring these resource groups with network settings, storage accounts, and other essential infrastructure components.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

4. Setting up RBAC to ensure the right level of access is granted to users and groups.
This helps in maintaining security and operational integrity by adhering to the principle of least privilege.
Monitoring and Logging:

5. Configuring monitoring solutions like Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics.
Ensuring that all activities and resource usage within the subscription are tracked and logged for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

6. Cost Management:
Implementing cost management and budgeting tools to monitor and control spending within the subscription.
Setting up alerts and notifications to prevent budget overruns.

Example Scenario
Imagine an organization that frequently launches new projects. Each project requires its own isolated Azure subscription to avoid resource conflicts and to apply specific governance policies. Instead of manually creating and configuring each new subscription, the organization sets up a subscription vending process.

1. Request:
A team member submits a request for a new Azure subscription via a self-service portal or a service request form.

2. Approval Workflow:
The request goes through an approval process, where necessary stakeholders review and approve the creation of the new subscription.

3. Automation:
Once approved, an automation workflow (using tools like Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions) triggers the subscription creation process.
Terraform or ARM templates are used to provision the subscription, set up initial resources, apply policies, and configure RBAC.

4. Notification:
The team member receives a notification once the new subscription is ready, with details on how to access and manage it.


Example Terraform Code for Subscription Vending
Here's a simplified example using Terraform to illustrate how you might automate part of the subscription vending process

# Define variables
variable "subscription_name" {
  description = "Name of the new subscription"
  type        = string
}

variable "management_group_id" {
  description = "ID of the management group where the subscription will be created"
  type        = string
}

variable "billing_account_id" {
  description = "ID of the billing account for the subscription"
  type        = string
}

# Create the subscription
resource "azurerm_subscription" "new_subscription" {
  name                = var.subscription_name
  billing_scope_id    = var.billing_account_id
  management_group_id = var.management_group_id
}

# Apply policies and RBAC roles as needed
resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "example_policy" {
  name                 = "example-policy-assignment"
  scope                = azurerm_subscription.new_subscription.id
  policy_definition_id = "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/<policy_definition_id>"
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example_role" {
  scope              = azurerm_subscription.new_subscription.id
  role_definition_name = "Contributor"
  principal_id       = "<principal_id>"
}
